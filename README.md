## What I Learned from this project

There were tons of things I learned about Next.js version 13 from this project.  For starters, Next 13 is all about server components and I made sure to leverage the full power of it.  All of my data is prefetched and statically generated on the server before being served to the client as plain html.  I learned about Incremental Static Regeneration from this project as well.  Essentially, this project is set up so that Next.js checks to see if there were any changes/updates to this project every few hours and rebuilds whatever new updates/changes occurred so that the site remains up to date while also serving static content.  

In addition to all of Next 13's cool features, I also learned a ton about Sanity's powerful set of developer tools including their easy to set up back end and their in-house query language, GROQ.

Lastly, this project was a chance for me to dive deeper into using Tailwind.css, which is an exremely popular CSS utility library that I have wanted to use more.  At first, I didn't like how bloated my JSX looked from all the different classes but after using it for a while, I learned the value of being able to not only write CSS faster from this tool but also being able to easily see what CSS rules are being applied from the class names themselves.
